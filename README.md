# Project Echo - Wear OS Audio Recorder

🎤 **Project Echo** - Professional Wear OS audio recorder with AI transcription capabilities. Record on your watch, sync to phone, get instant text transcription.

## 📋 Implemented Features

### ✅ Core Audio Recording System
- **AudioRecord API Integration**: 44.1kHz sample rate, 16-bit PCM mono configuration
- **Circular Buffer System**: 10x minimum buffer size for stability and dropout prevention
- **Audio Focus Management**: Graceful handling of audio interruptions and focus changes
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from recording interruptions and buffer overruns

### ✅ Story 1: Quick Recording Start
- **One-Tap Recording**: Single tap to start/stop recording with instant readiness
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile confirmation for start, stop, and error states
- **Pre-initialized Audio**: AudioRecord initialized on app launch for zero-delay start
- **Permission Handling**: Graceful microphone permission requests with clear user guidance

### ✅ Story 2: Long Recording Stability
- **Extended Session Support**: Stable recording for hour-long sessions without dropouts
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time recording health metrics and buffer overrun detection
- **Partial Save Protection**: Automatic save of partial recordings on unexpected termination
- **Buffer Management**: Circular buffer with overflow protection and capacity monitoring

### ✅ User Interface
- **Material 3 Design**: Modern Wear OS optimized interface with dark theme
- **Real-time Status**: Live recording duration and health status display
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with recovery suggestions
- **Permission Flow**: User-friendly permission request flow with rationale

### ✅ Technical Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns with ViewModels and UI state
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous audio processing with proper lifecycle management
- **Thread Safety**: Lock-free circular buffer with atomic operations
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management
